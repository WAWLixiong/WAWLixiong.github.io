Fly Me To The Moon (Nat King Cole版）
Songwriter:Bart Howard Composed By:Bart Howard
Arranged by:Toshiyuki Ohmori Vocal:CLAIRE

Poets often use many words to say a simple thing
It takes thought and time and rhyme to make a poem sing
With music and words I've been playing
For you I have written a song
To be sure that you have known what I am saying
I'll translate as I go alone
Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
(I want you)Let me see what Spring is like On Jupiter and Mars
In other words,hold my hand
In other words,darling,kiss me
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forever more
(Because)You are all I long for All I worship and adore
In other words,please be true
In other words,I love you
```
