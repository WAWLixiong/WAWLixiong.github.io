## wsl端口在windows通过localhost访问

    Now Microsoft will forward ports in linux by wslhost.exe when .wslconfig includes localhostForwarding=true (which is ture by default), see wsl-config. But, all those ports will only listen at local network on windows host, which means you can't access them from other devices in the same network. For now, wslpp will still open a same port listening at all interfaces, but if you don't need network access at this, you probably don't need wslpp at all, wslhost.exe is enough
